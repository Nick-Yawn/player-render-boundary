# OSRS Player Render Boundary

A RuneLite plugin that draws a square boundary centered at the player's true tile, showing where other players and NPCs begin to be rendered.

## Configuration

The plugin provides the following settings:

- **Boundary Color**: The color of the render boundary (default: white, 50% opacity)
- **Boundary Width**: The width of the boundary line in pixels (default: 1, range: 1-4)

## Ackowledgements

I studied https://github.com/tylerwgrass/attack-ranges to understand how to draw boundaries on tiles.
